012_simple

This dataset is derived from virus-PTCdata with SNR 2,4,7. z=6.
It consists of 30060 10x10-images, devided in three classes:
	1. images without any spots -> classlabel "0"
	2. images with exactly one spot -> classlabel "1"
	3. images with exactly two spots -> classlabel "2"
Spots are "in" an image, if their center is in the image. The position of the spots (in center or at the edge) is NOT taken into account.
For class 1: z_lim=9; look at all depths, to make sure there is absolutely no spot in no depth.
For class 2&3: z_lim=3; Spots that are to far out of focus should not be taken into account.
