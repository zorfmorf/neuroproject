zeroedge

This dataset is derived from virus-PTCdata with the named snr-levels. z=6.
It consists of 50000 16x16-images, devided in five classes:
	1. No spots in the image -> Classlabel "0"
	2. Exactly one spot in space -> Classlabel "1"
	3. Exactly two spots in space -> Classlabel "2"
	4. One spot at the edge of the image -> Classlabel "0"
	5. One spot at the edge and one in space -> Classlabel "1"
This set wants to train a network no ignore spots which are at the edges of the images.
z_lim = 3.
