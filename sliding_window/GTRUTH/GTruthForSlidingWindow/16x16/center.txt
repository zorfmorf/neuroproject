center

This dataset is derived from virus-PTCdata with the named snr-levels. z=6.
It consists of 30060 16x16-images, devided in three classes:
	1. images without any spots -> classlabel "0"
	2. images with a spot in the center -> classlabel "1"
	3. images with no spot in the center -> classlabel "0"
Wheter a spot is in or outside of something depends on its exact coordinate given by ground-truth. 
The "Center" of an image of 16x16 is the top-left pixel of the four pixels which touch the real center with their corners, so in pixel-coordinates it is (8,8), starting at 1.
Not in the center means, its coordinate is not in a 5x5-pixel-region around the central pixel.
!!! All things that are in space of the image are NOT taken into account. Neither in number 2, nor in number 3. It is just one spot in the center in 2, around it, all is possible. Same for the center-region in 3.
For class 1: z_lim=9; look at all depths, to make sure there is absolutely no spot in no depth.
For class 2&3: z_lim=3; Spots that are to far out of focus should not be taken into account.
